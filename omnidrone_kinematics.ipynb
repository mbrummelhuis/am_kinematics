    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook we do the derivation of the kinematics of the omnidrone for aerial tactile servoing. The final aim is to achieve a method for obtaining references for the controlled state velocities of the system (since the aerial platform is a quadrotor there is underactuation), which can be done by Jacobian (pseudo-)inverse methods. We regard the aerial manipulator as one system, thus the Jacobian is best derived from the centralised kinematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Robot model\n",
    "The robot is modelled as a kinematic chain where the first link is the drone platform, which is 'connected' to the environment by a 6DOF freedom joint (i.e. the drone can move independently from the environment). Then, the manipulator consists of three links (with lengths L1, L2, L3) with three revolute joints.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Denavit-Hartenberg for deriving the kinematics. Special attention needs to be paid to the intended workspace, because the Euler angle representation of the end-effector orientation implies singularities when the pitch (i.e. rotation about y) is $\\pi/2 \\vee -\\pi/2$. It is wise to define reference frames (in particular, the manipulator base frame $\\mathcal{F}_{0}$) such that these singularities are not close to the intended operational space in the workspace. We derive the kinematics in the homogeneous transformation matrix form, then we get the 6-dimensional kinematic function from the homogeneous transformation matrix. Finally, we can derive the Jacobian matrix by taking the partial derivative of each kinematic function element w.r.t. each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## State definition\n",
    "The state of the aerial manipulator $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ is defined as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{\\xi} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{b} & y_{b} & z_{b} & \\psi_{b} & \\theta_{b} & \\varphi_{b} & q_{1} & q_{2} & q_{3}\\end{bmatrix}^{\\top}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "with $x_{b}$, $y_{b}$, and $z_{b}$ the position of the drone body CoM in the inertial frame, angles $\\psi_{b}$, $\\theta_{b}$, and $\\varphi_{b}$ the Euler angles (yaw, pitch, roll) of the drone rotation with intrinsic ZYX convention, and $q_{1}$, $q_{2}$, and $q_{3}$ the angles of the revolute joints of the manipulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by setting up the relevant symbols and elementary rotation matrices with Sympy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rotation convention\n",
    "The yaw, pitch, roll (YPR) convention common in aerospace follows an intrinsic (that is, about the moving coordinate system) rotation about the body Z, Y, and X axes. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the calculation of the associated rotation matrices see the code below. This also shows that the YPR convention is equal to an extrinsic (that is, about the inertial coordinate system) rotation in the order XYZ.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convention used here thus corresponds to the Euler ZYX mentioned in this source: http://web.mit.edu/2.05/www/Handout/HO2.PDF \\\n",
    "And this corresponds to the rotation matrix derived here: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11071-022-08212-w"

    "- One of the advantages of this approach is that we do not need to rely on position estimates of the drone, which are notoriously difficult to get accurate in outdoor conditions. The other states can be estimated with exceeding precision.\n",
    "- The instantaneous reference state is the current state position, and a targeted state velocity. Therefore, we can use __measured__ states to evaluate the Jacobian."
